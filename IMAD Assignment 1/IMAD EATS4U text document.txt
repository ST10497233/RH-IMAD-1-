Design considerations
On average, people spend between 3 to 5 hours a day using mobile apps. With so many options available, the competition is intense. To create a successful app, the most vital component to focus on is user experience. This determines whether an app is user-friendly and effective, making it simple to navigate, visually appealing, and easy to use.
•	Screen size: Design for common smartphone sizes and make sure it works well on screens between 4.7 and 6.5 inches.

•	Simplicity: When designing the app you must think about the users. It must be easy to understand, simple to navigate and it must be visually appealing. This way anybody can use it without confusion.

•	Finger-friendly mobile design: The app has to be easy to use with both hands or either hand. Make the buttons big enough to tap easily and design it so that important features are within easy reach of the thumb.

•	Consistency in design: To make sure the app looks nice and is easy to use everything should match. Keep icons, fonts and colours consistent. Make sure buttons and menus work consistently across the entire app.

•	Feedback and Visual cues: Make sure the app is easy to use and works fast. The feedback the app is giving should make the user feel like they are flowing.
